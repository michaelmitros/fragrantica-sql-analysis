# Perfume Fragrances Data Analysis â€” SQL Project

Welcome to my SQL project analyzing a dataset of fragrances.  
In this project, I explored data to find insights about perfume brands, fragrance releases, common scent accords, and growth trends.

---

## About the Dataset

- The dataset was obtained from Kaggle
- The dataset **frag** contains records of perfume fragrances with attributes like brand, perfume name, release year, scent accords, ratings, and more.
- The goal was to analyze and extract key metrics about the fragrance market using SQL.
